## Overview

This is my Porfolio project for Coding Dojo Web Fundamentals Stack. I implemented methods that I learned during the course to create a portfolio to display my coding accomplishments. 

I was able to combine HTML/CSS/Javascript for this project.

Some things I learned were how to use setTimeout, addEventListener, and combining conditions with functions with relation to DOM.
